## Analysing the interrelationship between industry specific sales and social stress as measured by Google Trends data

This propject is a continuation of my Statistics Canada Fall 2020 hackathon concept. 

Using tested infodemiological principles this paper proposes models to estimate levels of percieved stress by the general population in three general areas: sleep, employment, and anxiety.

## Data sources: 
* Google Trends
* Mental health characteristics and suicidal thoughts (Stats Canada, 2019)*
* Gross domestic product by industry, Sept 2020 (Stats Canada, 2020)
* Tobacco, sales and inventories, monthly production (x1000) (Stats Canada, 2020)
* Monthly retail sales of beer, wine and liquor stores in Canada from 2015 to 2020 (in billion Canadian dollars) (Statista, 2020)

## Tools/Packages:
* Excel
* Jupyter Lab
* Python
* HTML

## Key findings: 
There were multiple economic indicators which showed significant correlation to the proposed models. Distinct patterns of acute and chronic stress may inferred from the
time adjusted and non-adjusted mental distress index and represent economical manifestations of physiological acute and chronic stress. The correlation to chronic stress on alcohol (R2 = .22), healthcare (R2 = .05) are greater then that of acute stress (R2 = .10 and .04 accordingly). Acute stress was more strongly related to cannabis (R2 = .32) and tobacco sales (R2 = .15). It should be noted that tobacco had no relation to chronic stress (R2 = 0) while cannabis still maintained a moderate correlation (R2 = .22) with chronic stress.
